# Student-Information-System
This is a java project that manages student information and lets the user perform various operations such as insertion/deletion/updation on the data .It also provides an admin section where the user can perform similar actions.

## About The Project
The project, “Student Information System” was developed using JAVA NetBeans as 
the Java based GUI platform for front-end development while MySQL served as the 
back-end and was used as the DBMS to store the necessary databases.
The application primarily utilizes java database connectivity to interact with the 
MySQL server to add, update, delete and fetch records from the tables stored in the 
database and displays them in the front end of the NetBeans GUI application.
Upon execution, the application window for “Login Info” pops up which takes the 
input of email and password in text fields and password fields respectively. When the 
user inputs the email and password, the application processes it and checks with the 
database records. When this information matches the records, the user is prompted to 
the homepage where the user can select their respective operation that they want to 
perform. Upon logging in to the correct portal using identity and password, the 
students or admin can add, update or delete the info stored in their respective 
databases’ table. They can also view their records while logged in to check their info. 
To modify the records, the java program makes a query to the SQL server which is 
then executed to make necessary changes in the table. Upon successful execution, the 
updated records are presented to the user by fetching the records from the 
corresponding table.
Hence, the students can add, edit, delete, update and view all information within their 
access while the admin can protect confidential data from unauthorized access and 
prevent any manipulation of data. Further, it makes the process of data access fast, 
secure and user friendly with proper presentation.
